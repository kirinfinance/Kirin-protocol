## Governance

Under the Gnosis safe multi-sig wallet controlling, RIN will be developed into a fully community-driven DeFi project.



## Distribution

10,000 RIN as a reward for the first pool of staking UniV2 UNI_ETH LP token.

The rest of the RIN(70,000) will all be deposited in the multi-sig wallet for the next stage. Kirin finance may finally setup 8 independent product(not necessary pool) subprojects to allocate the rest of RIN. The ultimate goal of kirin finance is to explore a future decentralized finance system to help grow the value of RIN and permissionless access finance service.
